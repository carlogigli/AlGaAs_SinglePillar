# AlGaAs_SinglePillar

The following repository treats the analysis of linear and nonlinear scattering of all-dielectric nanoresonators, explicitly AlGaAs nanopillars on AlOx substrate.

## Linear Scattering of AlGaAs Nanopillars

Linear scattering of AlGaAs nanopillars is studied in the nIR range using COMSOL with MATLAB platform. The choice of FEM analysis derives from the future necessity of using bulk nonlinearity of the material, so every surface approximation method (eg MOM) seems not appropriate.
